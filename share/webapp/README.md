## Construct Client

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/irCGEIH.png" />

This client provides a fully functioning Matrix chat experience in addition to driving the server
administration functions of IRCd. This client should not de-prioritize the chat client features
in favor of focusing on server admin: it is testbed for any new features and experimentation
conducted with IRCd.
