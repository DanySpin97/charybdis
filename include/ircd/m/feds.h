/// Concurrent federation request interface. This fronts several of the m::v1
/// requests and conducts them to all servers in a room (e.g. m::room::origins)
/// at the same time. The hybrid control flow of this interface is best suited
/// to the real-world uses of these operations.
///
/// Each call in this interface is synchronous and will block the ircd::ctx
/// until it returns. The return value is the for_each-protocol result based on your
/// closure (if the closure ever returns false, the function also returns false).
///
/// The closure is invoked asynchronously as results come in. If the closure
/// returns false, the interface function will return immediately and all
/// pending requests will go out of scope and may be cancelled as per
/// ircd::server decides.
