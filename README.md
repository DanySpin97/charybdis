# This — is The **Construct**

#### Internet Relay Chat daemon: *Matrix Construct*

IRCd was a free and open source server which facilitated real-time communication over the
internet. It was started by Jarkko Oikarinen in 1988 at the University of Oulu and [its
derivatives](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/IRCd_software_implementations.png)
underpinned the major IRC networks for decades.

Due to its age and stagnation since the mid-2000's, a growing number of proprietary cloud services
are now filling the vacuum of innovation. In 2014 a new approach was proposed to reinvigorate
real-time communication for free and open source software: a *federation of networks* known as
*the matrix*.

**This is the Construct** — the first Matrix server written in C++. It is designed to be
fast and highly scalable, and to be community developed by volunteer contributors over
the internet. This mission strives to make the software easy to understand, modify, audit,
and extend. It remains true to its roots with its modular design and having minimal
requirements.

Even though all of the old code has been rewritten, the same spirit and
_philosophy of its predecessors_ is still obvious throughout.

Similar to the legacy IRC protocol's origins, Matrix wisely leverages technologies in vogue
for its day to aid the virility of implementations. A vibrant and growing ecosystem
[already exists](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html).

#### Dependencies

- **Boost** (1.66 or later)
Replacing libratbox with the rich and actively developed libraries.

- **RocksDB** (based on LevelDB):
A lightweight and embedded database superseding sqlite3.

- **Sodium** (NaCl crypto):
Provides ed25519 required for the Matrix Federation.

- **OpenSSL** (libssl/libcrypto):
Provides HTTPS TLS / X.509 / etc.

- **GNU C++ compiler**, **automake**, **autoconf**, **autoconf2.13**,
**autoconf-archive**, **libtool**, **shtool**

##### Additional dependencies

- **libmagic** (~Optional~):
Content MIME type recognition.

- **zlib** or **lz4** or **snappy** (Optional):
Provides compression for the database, etc.

*Notes*:
- libircd requires a platform capable of loading dynamic shared objects at runtime.

## Installation

<a href="https://github.com/tulir/gomuks">
	<img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/30zJfPb.png" />
</a>

### Building from git (RELEASE)

```
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

#### Building from git (DEVELOPER PREVIEW)

*This is only intended to allow isolated development with dependencies that have not made
their way to mainstream systems yet.*
**Not for release.**

```
./autogen.sh
mkdir build
```

- The install directory may be this or another place of your choosing.
- If you decide elsewhere, make sure to change the `--prefix` in the `./configure`
statement below.

```
CXX=g++-6 ./configure --prefix=$PWD/build --with-included-boost=shared --with-included-rocksdb=shared
```

- Many systems alias `g++` to an older version. To be safe, specify a version manually
in `CXX`. This will also build the submodule dependencies with that version.
- The `--with-included-*` will fetch, configure **and build** the dependencies included
as submodules. Include `=shared` for now until static libraries are better handled.

```
make
make install
```

## Plan

#### Roadmap for service

- [x] **Phase One**: Matrix clients using HTTPS.
- [ ] **Phase Two**: Legacy IRC networks using TS6 protocol.
- [ ] **Phase Three**: Legacy IRC clients using RFC1459 / RFC2812 legacy grammars.

#### Roadmap for deployments

The deployment mode is a macro of configuration variables which tune the daemon
for how it is being used. Modes mostly affect aspects of local clients.

- [x] **Personal**: One or few users. Few default restrictions; higher log output.
- [ ] **Company**: Hundreds of users. Moderate default restrictions.
- [ ] **Public**: Thousands of users. Untrusting configuration defaults.

#### Roadmap for innovation

- [x] Phase Zero: **Core libircd**: Utils; Modules; Contexts; JSON; Database; HTTP; etc...
- [x] Phase One: **Matrix Protocol**: Core VM; Core modules; Protocol endpoints; etc...
- [ ] Phase Two: **Construct Cluster**: Kademlia sharding of events; Maymounkov's erasure codes.
